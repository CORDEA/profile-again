I'm an android applications engineer at LINE Corporation, and live in Tokyo. LINE is my 4th company and I have been working since Feb 2021. I currently focus on development of Android native applications, but always have interests widely, and I'm still working on many things as a hobby. For example, Flutter, AWS, Docker, Font-end technologies etc. In programming language, I mainly use Kotlin / Java at work. As a hobby, developing using many programming languages, using Python, Nim, Golang, C#, JavaScript etc (Please see Skills for details). Native language is Japanese. English uses to read api document and to write commit message, issue, blog, but I am not good at talking.
